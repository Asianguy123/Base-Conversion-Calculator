# Base-Conversion-Calculator
A base conversion calculator between binary, denary, hexadecimal, octal and BCD - made using Python3

# Requirements
 - **Level 1** - convert binary <==> denary and negative binary <==> denary
 - **Level 2** - convert hexadecimal <==> binary and hexadecimal <==> denary (negative hex not required)
 - **Level 3** - negative binary to be represented in user's choice between sign magnitude and two's complement binary
 - **Level 4** - negative binary could be displayed in one's complement
 - **Level 5** - conversions between denary, binary, hexadecimal, octal and BCD (binary coded decimal)
 - **Level 6** - denary, binary and hexadecimal addition and subtraction
 - **Level 7** - create a GUI for the calculator

# How to run
**coming soon**

# What I learnt
 - how to convert binary, denary and hexadecimal <==>
 - how to represent and convert to and from negative binary using two's complement

# Improvements
